      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm a working journalist who has decided that web development seems like a much better way to make a living. I am looking forward to this course and, hopefully, to a career change. Let's learn to code.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Dallas, TX</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to read, go to the movies, take long walks, and ride my bike around town.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Right now, I'm dreaming of gainful employment as a web developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>East Dallas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm interested in the craft. We spend so much of our lives online, and it would be fascinating to understand more of what goes into creating these digital environments. I appreciate the demand (and average salaries) for web developers and tech workers. My wife is also a web developer, and does compelling and challenging work.</p>
